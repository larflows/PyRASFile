    Generate all possible permutations of the given flows across the relevant nodes,

    upstream of them.  Optionally, write to a CSV compatible with the format specified in
    csvReader.py for later use.

    :param nodes: A list of the nodes, each node being a dictionary of "river", "reach", and "rs"
    :param upstreamNodes: A dictionary of which nodes are upstream of which, in the format {node: [upstream nodes]},
                            where the nodes are in the format given by mkFlowHeader from profileWriter.py.
                            Note that the upstream nodes must be a list of the furthest-upstream nodes, none of which
                            are themselves downstream of any other nodes, or it will not work.

    The idea here:
        First node: each flow in order repeated nperms / n. flows times, run once
        Second node: each flow in order repeated nperms / (n. flows)^2 times, run n. flows times
        nth node: each flow in order repeated nperms / (n. flows)^n times, run n.flows ^ n times
    Therefore, we iterate through the number of permutations first (0 to n.flows - 1), and within each loop,
    we iterate through the number of flows.
    
    For each entry in the permutations, the index in the flows needs to be (0 * nreps), (1 * nreps), etc, which should
    be... Let's look at it with 2 flows and 3 upstream locations.  Our permutations of indices are:
    0 0  0 0  1 1  1 1
    0 0  1 1  0 0  1 1
    0 1  0 1  0 1  0 1
    
    So for the first row, it's index // 4 = index // (nflows ^ 2) = index // (nflows ^ (nuc - 1))
    Second row, it's index // 2 mod 2 = index // nflows mod nflows = index // (nflows ^ (nuc - 2)) mod nflows
    Third row, it's index mod 2 = index // (nflows ^ (nuc - 3)) mod nflows
    
    So our overall formula should be... (index // (nflows ^ (nuc - row - 1))) mod nflows.
    
    This runs across the number of rows nuc, and within each row, index iterates from 0 to nperms
