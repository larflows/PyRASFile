"""
Written beginning July 22, 2019 by Daniel Philippus for the LAR Environmental Flows project at Colorado School of Mines.

This component of the program parses a CSV file to produce the appropriate flow inputs for the profile writer.  As
of the present state of development, the user must still manually specify boundary conditions and the other inputs.
The flow data is expected to typically be the most complex, and therefore the part which would benefit the most from
automated input from a format which other programs can conveniently generate.

The CSV format is expected to be as follows:

river,reach,rs,profilenumber,flow

Where flow is a floating-point value in cubic feet per second, profilenumber is an integer,
and the remaining entries are strings.

The order of these can be varied (if specified in the relevant functions or if a header is included),
but the names must remain the same.

    Given a CSV parsed into a list of lists, convert it into a list of dictionaries, either with the first line
    as headers or with a specified column order.

    If types is true, it will also parse the entries according to the parsing functions in coltypes; if not,
    it will leave them all as strings.  coltypes must be specified if types is True.  coltypes should be a dictionary
    of {column: parser}, e.g. {"profilenumber": int}.

    The empty-related parameters are ignored unless types is True.  If types are being used, then, if an entry is empty:
